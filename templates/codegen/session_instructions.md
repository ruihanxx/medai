{% if resuming %}
This stage is resuming after an interrupted code-generation attempt. Inspect the
existing files in `{{ codebase_dir }}/`, preserve valid completed work, repair or
finish incomplete work, and rerun every self-review check before declaring the
stage complete.
{% else %}
You are implementing a medical paper's methodology from scratch in an empty codebase.
{% endif %}
By the end of this session, the directory at `{{ codebase_dir }}/` must contain a runnable
implementation of the paper's methodology.


## Inputs
- Paper Markdown: `{{ paper_markdown }}`
- Data: `{{ data_dir or "not supplied" }}`
- Previously extracted reproduction informations, which include:
   - Claims: `{{ claims_path }}`
   - Experiments to reproduce: `{{ experiments_path }}`


## Available skills

A catalog of scientific-computing skills is staged at
`{{ skills_dir }}/`. Each subdirectory has a `SKILL.md` whose
YAML frontmatter `description:` field summarizes when the skill applies.
You may browse the catalog and use a skill if its description genuinely
matches your work; many papers will not need any skill, and that is fine.

Before writing `codegen_plan.json` (Step 2.5), run
`ls {{ skills_dir }}/` and read each `SKILL.md`'s description.
If any skill matches your paper's domain or methodology, note it — you
can invoke its scripts and reference docs while implementing in Step 3.

## Workflow

Follow this four-step structure. Take time on each step; do not rush.

### 1. Explore

Read the paper carefully. Prioritize:

- **Methodology / Methods** sections — the procedures you will implement.
- **Cohort construction / Experimental setup / Data** sections — hyperparameters,
  dataset specs, initial conditions, cohort construction rules.
- **Model architecture / Algorithms** — what to build.

Read the claims at `{{ claims_path }}` and experiments at `{{ experiments_path }}` as supplement to make it clear the output to yield and the structure of the experiment.
Validation claims may originate from a Figure/Table; their `provenance.section` identifies the source label. When needed, inspect the corresponding image linked from `{{ paper_markdown }}` to implement the intermediate check.

You may also skim Results and Discussion sections for context, but
do not memorize numerical results for hardcoding (see Self-Review).

### 2. Plan

First choose the computational stack, then outline the file structure.

**Match the paper's computational demands.** You can refer to the extracted experiment at `{{ experiments_path }}` for computational demands of each experiment. If it is recorded `"NA"`, you need to infer the computational demands from the paper. Implement in the language and framework the methodology genuinely needs, not whichever is fastest to write. If the method's scale depends on compiled or GPU performance — a large-N numerical simulation, an iterative sampling or optimization procedure with many steps, large-scale model training or inference — use tools that deliver it: GPU-enabled libraries (PyTorch / CuPy / JAX) when a GPU is present, JIT or vectorized paths (numba), C/C++ extensions via the available gcc toolchain, or R for R-native methods — pure Python/NumPy on CPU is the easy default, but it is only correct when the paper's own scale doesn't need more. An implementation that is faithful on paper but cannot run at the paper's scale will fail the replication. 
{% if gpu_info %}

**This environment has local GPU resources**: {{ gpu_info | tojson }}. Compare their
count and available VRAM with the paper's full-scale computational demands. If
they are sufficient (they don't need to be exactly the same as the paper's demand, as long as the capacity is sufficient), use them through a GPU-enabled library (PyTorch / CuPy /
JAX) rather than implementing the GPU-dependent work on CPU. 
{% else %}

**No local NVIDIA GPU was detected during preflight.**
{% endif %}

{% if computation_provider %}
If the paper requires GPU resources that are unavailable or insufficient
locally, check {{ computation_provider }} for resources meeting the required
GPU type, count, and VRAM. If a matching resource is available, rent it by
following `{{ skills_dir }}/computation_provider/SKILL.md`. After selecting the
provider, read the provider reference required by that skill before performing
any provider operation. Store the instance state at
`{{ computation_provider_state_path }}`
and leave it running for the plan and replication stages. If no matching
resource is available, stop explicitly. Do not rent weaker hardware or reduce
the experiment scale.
{% else %}
If the paper requires GPU resources that are unavailable or insufficient
locally, stop explicitly: no remote computation provider is configured. Do not
reduce the experiment scale or silently substitute CPU execution.
{% endif %}

Before committing to a stack, run the `get-available-resources` skill (`{{ skills_dir }}/get-available-resources/scripts/detect_resources.py`) to see actual CPU core count, RAM, and GPU VRAM — size your implementation to what is actually there instead of guessing capacity.

Outline the file structure of your codebase before writing any code:

- What modules do you need?
- What is their dependency order?
- Where will entry points live?
- What dependencies (packages, system libraries) are needed?

Track Python dependencies in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` (your choice; pick one and be consistent); a non-Python stack additionally uses its native manifest (e.g. R's `DESCRIPTION`).

**Dataset Processing and Cohort Construction**

{% if data_dir %}
Inspect `{{ data_dir }}` directly as needed to implement the paper.
Keep the raw root read-only. Bound the number of files, bytes, rows, and field
lengths read. Never extract archives or deserialize pickle, joblib, model
checkpoints, or any other format that may execute code. Prefer dataset
documentation and metadata before sampling large files; inspect only the
representative content required for implementation.
{% else %}
No data was supplied. Do not invent a dataset or fabricate data-dependent
results.
{% endif %}

Strictly follow the paper's dataset processing and cohort construction procedures.

When the paper uses specialized cohort, clinical, or methodological terms that cannot be mapped directly to the available dataset, infer the closest executable implementation using the dataset schema, metadata, and relevant medical knowledge. If the mapping remains unclear, search external sources.

Do not skip, weaken, or obscure any requirement because of uncertainty. Record every non-direct mapping in the form of `"ambiguities"` in step 2.5.

Do not directly read large data files. First read the available document to get basic informations.

If using a document during this run naturally reveals information that the document omitted, append an entry to `{{ dataset_patch_path }}`. This file is initialized as a JSON array, and every entry must have exactly this form:
```json
{
  "file name": "dataset_graph.yaml",
  "patch_content": {}
}
```
Set `"file name"` to the document's file name. Set `"patch_content"` to only
the missing content, structured like the target document so it can be reviewed
and applied later. If this run does not naturally encounter an omission, leave the initialized empty array unchanged. Do not proactively search those documents for omissions. Only add important omissions; it's ok to omit some not generally used details.

### 2.5. Capture the plan to disk

Before writing code, write `codegen_plan.json` at the codebase root with
your decisions so they are inspectable and machine-readable. Schema:

```json
{
  "files": [
    {"path": "src/model.py", "responsibility": "..."},
    {"path": "src/dataset.py", "responsibility": "..."}
  ],
  "dependency_order": ["src/dataset.py", "src/model.py", "..."],
  "entry_points": ["main.py"],
  "shared_state": "What modules pass between them, e.g. 'Dataset returns (X, y) tuples consumed by trainer'.",
  "ambiguities": [
    {
      "question": "Paper says 'we use a small batch size' without naming a value.",
      "assumption": "Defaulted to batch_size=32, configurable via config.yaml."
    }
  ]
}
```

The `ambiguities` field is the place to flag every point where the paper
underspecifies methodology and you had to make a judgment call. List the
question and the assumption you took. Downstream phases use this to
distinguish "paper-underspecified" from "agent-misimplemented" outcomes.

### 3. Implement

Write the code, module-by-module. Guidelines:

- Prefer small, focused files. One clear responsibility per file.
- Use the paper's own variable names where natural.
- **Extract every paper-stated hyperparameter into `config.yaml` at the
  codebase root.** Use one section per logical group: `training:` (learning
  rate, batch size, epochs, optimizer settings, seeds), `model:` (layer
  sizes, activation choice, dropout), `data:` (dataset name, split sizes,
  preprocessing knobs), and any methodology-specific group (`sampling:`,
  `mcmc:`, etc.). Reference values from `config.yaml`; do not hardcode
  hyperparameters in `.py` files. A code reader should be able to audit
  every paper-stated input by reading one file.
- Set up dataset paths and other inputs as configuration the methodology
  calls for; don't hardcode anything that needs to be computed.
- You may install packages, create directories, and structure the
  repo as you see fit.
- Do not run the methodology end-to-end. That is a later phase.
  Your job is to produce the codebase; verifying it imports cleanly
  is part of Self-Review, but a full training/inference run is out
  of scope.


### 4. Self-Review

Before declaring done, complete every item in this audit:

#### a. Re-read methodology, then audit faithfulness

Open the paper again. For each algorithm / procedure described:

- Find the corresponding code.
- Confirm it implements what the paper says, not what you assumed.
- Fix any divergence.

#### b. Inputs-vs-outputs audit (anti-leakage)

The paper distinguishes two kinds of numbers: **inputs** (configuration
prescribed by the methodology — hyperparameters, batch size, dataset
size, model architecture, version pins, simulation initial conditions)
and **outputs** (results the paper reports — accuracy, posterior
estimates, table values).

- **Inputs** are allowed as constants in your code.
- **Outputs** must be **computed by your code**, not hardcoded.

Test for each numerical constant: *would this number change if the
experiment were re-run? If yes, it is an output and must be computed.
If no, it is an input and may be hardcoded.*

Examples:

| Paper says | Type | Hardcode? |
|---|---|---|
| "learning rate 2e-5, batch size 32, 3 epochs" | Input | Yes |
| "trained on 161 systems from Albrecht+22" | Input | Yes (dataset spec) |
| "model achieved 92.3% accuracy" | Output | No — compute it |
| "posterior mean w_1 = 0.719 ± 0.085" | Output | No — compute it |
| "max_treedepth=13" | Input | Yes |
| "rhat values were all <1.01 after sampling" | Output | No — compute it |

Scan every numerical constant in your code and apply the test. If a
constant matches a paper-reported result, replace it with code that
computes the value from the methodology.

c. Import sanity

For each Python module you wrote, run:

```bash
python -c "import <module_name>"
```

Fix any `ImportError`, `SyntaxError`, or `ModuleNotFoundError`. The codebase must be importable end-to-end before you exit. For non-Python components, run the equivalent smoke check (the C/C++ code compiles; R sources parse).

#### d. Dependency completeness

Re-open `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt`. Are all imports listed?
Do versions pin to what the paper used (when stated)?

#### e. Config audit

Open `config.yaml`. For each paper-stated hyperparameter, confirm:

- It lives in `config.yaml`, not as a literal in a `.py` file.
- Its value matches the paper. (If the paper specifies a range or "we
  tried X, Y, Z", pick the value used for the paper's headline result
  and record the alternatives in `codegen_plan.json["ambiguities"]`.)
- Code that needs the value reads it from `config.yaml`, not from a
  default function argument or a module-level constant.

If you find a paper-stated hyperparameter not in `config.yaml`, move it.

#### f. Ambiguity audit

Open `codegen_plan.json`. For each entry in `ambiguities`, confirm the
chosen assumption is reflected in the code (typically a `config.yaml`
value) and that the assumption was a reasonable best-guess given the
paper. If, during implementation, you encountered an underspecification
you didn't record, add it now. Future phases rely on this list.

#### g. Intermediate-anchor & selection-sanity audit

Most methodologies have an **upstream step** — a selection, grouping,
coordinate cut, unit/zero-point correction, or fit — whose output silently
feeds every downstream result. A wrong choice here is the single largest
source of cascade failures: one mis-selected sample corrupts every claim
that depends on it. For each such upstream step, confirm:

- **Apply every documented transformation, even "optional"-sounding ones.**
  If the methodology prescribes a transform — a normalization/standardization,
  a baseline or zero-point subtraction, a unit/frame conversion, or a domain
  correction (e.g. a batch-effect correction in genomics; deflation to real
  terms in economics; a K-correction or dereddening in astronomy) — apply it
  in the code. Do NOT assume the input already has it on the basis of a prose
  phrase ("normalized counts", "deflated GDP", "K-corrected photometry"). If
  the data ships the term as a column (e.g. a `*_norm` / `_real` / `kcorr_*`
  field), that is a strong signal the correction is yours to apply.

- **Handle periodic / wrapped quantities with wrap-aware masks.** A cut near
  the wrap point of a periodic variable (a phase, a compass azimuth,
  time-of-day/day-of-year, or an angle/longitude such as RA or Galactic `l`)
  must match BOTH ends — e.g. `(x < 10) | (x > 350)`, never `abs(x) < 10`.

- **Disambiguate multiple-choice inputs by methodological fidelity.** When a
  step could use one of several plausible columns/keys/parameters — e.g. which
  data split (train vs validation vs test), which ID namespace groups records
  (gene symbol vs accession ID; customer vs household; `haloID` vs `fofID`),
  which grouping unit for a fixed-effect or clustered-error term, which
  instrument channel — do NOT silently pick one. Pick the option the
  methodology actually specifies; record the alternatives in
  `codegen_plan.json["ambiguities"]`.

- **Validate intermediates against documented METHOD anchors — never against
  reported results.** The extracted claims at `{{ claims_path }}` record the anchor claims whose `role` attribute has value `validation`, including anchors extracted from Figures/Tables. If the methodology states an intermediate the step should reproduce *as part of the procedure* (e.g. "features are scaled to
  unit variance", "the cut leaves N=27056 records", a fold count, a member
  count, a fit coefficient), have the code assert/log its own intermediate
  against that anchor, and if it is off, prefer the documented alternative. 

- **Sanity-check the step's output before using it downstream.** If a
  selection yields an implausible count (e.g. one sub-group far smaller than
  its sibling, or a cut that removes almost everything), a fit's coefficients
  land far from a stable solution, or a "stable range" collapses to a single
  point, treat the result as suspect: re-derive it robustly (e.g. seed an
  iterative fit or clustering from the data rather than from a hardcoded
  anchor), or record the fragility in `codegen_plan.json["ambiguities"]`.
  Write these checks as assertions or warnings **in the code** so the
  replicate phase surfaces a corrupted intermediate instead of silently
  propagating it into every claim.

## Hard constraints

- Write into `{{ codebase_dir }}/`, except that dataset-document improvements
  may be written to `{{ dataset_patch_path }}` as described above. Do not modify
  the source dataset documents or raw data.
- `codegen_plan.json` and `config.yaml` both live at the codebase root.
- Do not commit (no `git commit`) — the host-side EXIT trap captures
  the diff against an empty initial state.
- Do not run the methodology end-to-end; that is the next phase.
